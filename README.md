# RedClaw 🦀 — The 2MB RAM AI Agent

**RedClaw** is an ultra-lightweight, memory-safe personal AI agent written in Rust. It is specifically designed to run on the most resource-constrained hardware imaginable, such as $5 RISC-V or ARM SoCs, with a target footprint of **less than 2MB of RAM**.

Inspired by the pioneering work of **OpenClaw** and **nanobot**, and directly based on the architecture of **PicoClaw**, RedClaw represents the "bit-golfing" extreme of the AI agent world.

## 🧠 System Logic: How we hit 2MB

RedClaw follows a **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** pattern, but optimizes every step for embedded survival:

1.  **Exoskeleton (Rust Core)**: By using Rust with no Garbage Collector and `panic = "abort"`, we eliminate the runtime overhead that costs megabytes in Go or Python.
2.  **Curl Offloading**: Networking and TLS (encryption) are the biggest RAM consumers. RedClaw offloads these to the system's `curl` process via pipes (STDIN/STDOUT). This moves the ~2MB handshake buffers out of our process.
3.  **Streaming JSON Parser**: Instead of loading full API responses into RAM, RedClaw uses `serde_json::from_reader` to parse data byte-by-byte as it comes from the network.
4.  **Bit Golfing Memory**: 
    *   **Malloc Trim**: Forces the OS to reclaim unused heap memory after every interaction.
    *   **History Truncation**: Intelligently maintains a rolling history of 6-10 messages, ensuring tool-call sequences are never broken (preventing Gemini Error 400).
    *   **Flat-File Memory**: No Vector DB. Context is stored in simple Markdown files (`MEMORY.md`), read only when necessary.
5.  **Safety First**: Even at 2MB, security is not optional. Includes a substring-based blacklist for shell commands and a 256KB read limit for files.

## ⚙️ Configuration

RedClaw is provider-agnostic but highly recommends **OpenRouter** for its stability and normalized OpenAI-compatible output.

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "workspace": "./workspace",
      "model": "google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free"
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": { "api_key": "sk-or-v1-..." }
  }
}
```
